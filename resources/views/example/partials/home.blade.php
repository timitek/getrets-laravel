            <p class="lead">
                <strong>GetRETS&reg;</strong> is a product / service developed by <a href="http://www.timitek.com/" target="_blank">timitek</a>
                that makes it possible to quickly build real estate related applications for pulling listing data from
                several MLS's without having to know anything about RETS or IDX or worry about the pains of mapping and 
                storing listing data from these various sources.
                <br /><br />

                <strong>GetRETS&reg;</strong> as a service provides a RESTful API endpoint for consuming the data, and although it's not
                limited to only being used in PHP applications, and users aren't required to use our SDK, we have 
                provided a simple PHP SDK for the API and set of documentation for it's use, which can be downloaded at 
                <a href="https://github.com/timitek/getrets-php-sdk" target="_blank">github</a>.  Further documenation
                may be found at our website <a href="http://www.timitek.com" target="_blank">www.timitek.com</a>, or at our
